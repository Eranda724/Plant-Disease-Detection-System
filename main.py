    ## Welcome to the Plant Disease Recognition System!
    This application leverages **Deep Learning** and **Computer Vision** to identify diseases in plants from images of their leaves. 
    Our goal is to help farmers, gardeners, and agricultural experts take **proactive measures** to ensure healthy crops.

    ### üåü Key Features:
    - **Fast and Accurate** disease detection.
    - Supports multiple plant species and diseases.
    - User-friendly interface with clear predictions.
    - Offers actionable insights to treat the detected disease.

    ### ü§î How It Works:
    1. Upload an image of a plant leaf using the **Disease Recognition** section.
    2. The system will analyze the image using a trained machine learning model.
    3. You'll receive a detailed result indicating the disease and possible next steps.

    ### Why Use This App?
    - Protect your crops from spreading diseases.
    - Reduce guesswork and save time.
    - Increase yield and improve plant health efficiently.

    üõ†Ô∏è Powered by **TensorFlow** and **Streamlit** for an optimal experience.
